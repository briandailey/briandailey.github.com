On May 12, 2014 Nashville's Mayor Karl Dean signed [Executive Order #43](http://www.nashville.gov/Metro-Clerk/Legal-Resources/Executive-Orders/Mayor-Karl-Dean/kd043.aspx).
Thanks to the sartorially gifted [Jacques
Woodcock](https://twitter.com/jacques_thekit ) I was able to attend the event
in order to help answer questions from the media about how this is a Good
Thing.

In general, any level of transparency from government is a Good Thing. However,
some common issues that arise with "open data" is as follows:

- The data is often released in unfriendly formats (e.g., PDF, Word Documents)
    - This means the data is often summarized, so you get no details about the
      underlying data.
    - It's also more difficult to parse the data in any automated way
- The data is not timely enough to be useful.
    - Obviously, historical data can be useful in its own right, but as a
      general rule, the more timely the data, the more valuable it is.

In the past, this has certainly been an issue with data released from Metro
Nashville. However, the Executive Order is intended to address some of these
issues.

### The Good

#### The Objectives

First, the order has the following admirable objectives:

- Publish Open Data in a timely and consistent manner.
- Publish Open Data in machine-readable formats that engage the community by
soliciting their ideas, input, and creative energy to support the development
of applications and tools that enable the public to access, visualize, and
analyze Open Data in new and innovative ways.
- Adopt standards that improve transparency, access to Open Data, and improved
coordination and efficiencies across Metropolitan Government departments.

This addresses the two issues mentioned above. It's difficult to be precise
about what the adopted "standards" will be, but I assume it means that each
data set should have a clearly defined process for pushing it to Socrata.

#### The Platform

That leads me to the next good thing: Socrata. Socrata is the platform that
Metro has chosen to host their data. It's a common choice for municipalities.
New York, Chicago, and others have already been publishing their data sets on
the platform. It is, alas, a for-profit entity so there is some risk associated
with choosing it as a platform. From what I gathered in conversations with
Metro's Chief Innovation Officer [Yiaway
Yeh](http://www.nashville.gov/Government/Staff-Directory/Staff-Member-Details/ID/377/Yeh-Yiaway)
the platform is paid for with federal grants. Hopefully the continuity of the
underlying grants is not in question (if you have more information on this,
please leave a comment at the bottom!).

On the other hand, open source projects have a huge issue with long-term
support. Projects that cannot be maintained internally suffer from abandonment.
Any project that expects long-term viability must be absolutely dead-simple to
host and maintain (a great example of this is the [ESL
Map](http://www.eslmap.com/) written at HackNashville and the work done it by
my colleague [Jason Myers](http://twitter.com/jasonamyers)). Perhaps hosting it
with a for-profit company has it's upside in long-term viability.

Socrata platform's wide adoption makes it an overall good choice, in my opinion.
It's [well-documented](http://dev.socrata.com/), for starters.

### The Not-So-Great

I'm not terribly pleased with the list of exempted departments. It's a rather
long list with some fairly large departments:

> Board of Education/Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, Nashville Electric
> Service, Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority, Metropolitan Development
> and Housing Agency, Metropolitan Transit Authority,  Metropolitan Sports
> Authority, Convention Center Authority, Health and Educational Facilities
> Board, Industrial Development Board, non-professional employees of the Board
> of Health, and the offices of elected officials.  The Mayor requests,
> however, that the excluded entities voluntarily undertake to develop and
> adopt similar policies.

That last touch is nice, but I wonder if it will carry much weight.

### Let's Build Something!

The timing of the order coincides with the [National Day of Civic
Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/) and it's local branch, [Hack For Change
Nashville](http://hack4changenash.org/). I definitely look forward to seeing
what local developers do with this data!

What data sets do you find most interesting? What questions do you think
this data might answer? Leave a comment or get in touch with me on Twitter
