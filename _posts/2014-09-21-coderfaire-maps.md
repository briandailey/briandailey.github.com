Huge kudos to Cal & Kathy Evans as well as Jacques Woodcock for organizing the
third year of CoderFaire, a language-agnostic conference that pulls all kinds of
regional talent out of the woodwork.

I particularly enjoyed Jason Myers's talk: [Umm... so Yeah... Net Neutrality: Do You Know How this Internet Thing Works?](https://github.com/jasonamyers/coderfaire-net-neutrality#sources).
I'm not sure what I expected when I walked in the room, but it didn't exactly
go the direction I was expecting. Not having a background in networking, it was
a crash course in how the backbone of the internet works. I entered an ignorant
rube, and left a slightly less ignorant rube.

I also enjoyed the impromptu panel discussion of [12 Factor
Apps](http://12factor.net/) between [Paul Jones](http://pmjones.com) and
[Jacques Woodcock](https://twitter.com/jacques_thekit). We only got through the
first six factors before running out of time, but it was interesting hearing the
audience cover different implementations across various programming stacks.

Each break between talks was 20 minutes long. When looking at the calendar, that
seemed like a long time, but in reality it worked out quite well. It gave enough
time for the attendees to talk, drink some coffee, and mill for a bit before
having to find seats for the next talk. I'm not sure that was intentional or
not, but it was a nice touch.

I was happy to give a short talk on mapping geospatial data for the web. I gave
a similar talk at Barcamp two years ago, and the tools available have changed
significantly since then.

Here are the resources from my talk on mapping geosptial data on the web.
