Huge kudos to Cal & Kathy Evans as well as Jacques Woodcock for organizing the
third year of CoderFaire, a language-agnostic conference that pulls all kinds of
regional talent out of the woodwork.

I was happy to give a short talk on mapping geospatial data for the web. I gave
a similar talk at Barcamp two years ago, and the tools available have changed
significantly since then.
