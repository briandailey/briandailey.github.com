I have a silly rule that I apply to my LinkedIn network. If I haven't met you in person at least once, I won't add you to my network. If you request to add me and I don't know you, I always ask to grab coffee or lunch. It has been a great way to meet some interesting folks in Nashville.

However, I find it interesting that roughly 4 out of 5 of these requests go completely dark when I request coffee or lunch.

If you're just clicking random people to add to your network, what meaning does it have? I genuinely don't understand that.
