In business, there are a lot of awards. There are a lot of organizations that
spend time "recognizing" business leaders for their various accomplishments.
One assumes are great for company publicity, I suppose, but how effective are
they?

I've been preparing my talk on [Systematic Biases and the Software Developer](
http://pytennessee.tumblr.com/post/75150059974/pytn-profiles-brian-dailey-and-adafruit) for
[PyTennnessee](http://pytennessee.org) and I ran into research that would appear to be relevent.

Ulrike Malmendier and Geoffrey Tate wrote a paper titled [
Superstar CEOs](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=972725). The following quote
was included in [Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374533555/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0374533555&linkCode=as2&tag=rea036-20).

I was amused to find many of the award nomination forms I've seen include
several questions about which boards CEOs sit on.
