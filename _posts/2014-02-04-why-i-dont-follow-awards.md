In business, there are a lot of awards. There are a lot of organizations that
spend time "recognizing" business leaders for their various accomplishments.
One assumes are great for company publicity, I suppose, but how effective are
they?

I've been preparing my talk on [Systematic Biases and the Software Developer](
http://pytennessee.tumblr.com/post/75150059974/pytn-profiles-brian-dailey-and-adafruit) for
PyTennnessee and I ran into research that would appear to be relevent.

Ulrike Malmendier and Geoffrey Tate wrote a paper titled [
Superstar CEOs](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=972725).

I was amused to find many of the award nomination forms I've seen include
several questions about which boards CEOs sit on.
