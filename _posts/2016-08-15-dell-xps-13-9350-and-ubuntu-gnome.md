I recently bought a Dell XPS 13 9350 and installed Ubuntu Gnome 16.04. I bought the version with the FHD (1920x1080) screen resolution. While that's not exactly HiDPI, the text is rather small with the default installation.

If you, like me, have a difficult time reading the small text, you can bump it up with the Gnome Tweak Tool.

Open up the Tweak Tool and go to "Fonts."

Adjust the "Scaling Factor" to something reasonable, like 1.25.

You may need to restart some applications to see the change.
