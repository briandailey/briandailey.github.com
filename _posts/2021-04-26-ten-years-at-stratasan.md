In May of 2021, it will be ten years since we started Stratasan. Even though the
Stratasan adventure is far from over, it seems as good a time as any to write up
a retrospective.

## Wait... what's a Stratasan?

Stratasan is a company I co-founded with Jason Moore in 2011. [^1] We help
healthcare companies (usually acute care hospitals) see what's going on in
their market. Where should they build outpatient clinics? What specialists
should they hire, given demographic changes in their market? We also work to
collect healthcare data from facilities to report to various entities (e.g., a
state Department of Health or a hospital association) and to use for
business intelligence.

## Was it what I expected?

Yes and no. When Jason asked if I would come on full time, I said two things: I
saw it as a great opportunity to learn some new things, and I didn't figure
I would be a good fit for technical leadership once the company grew to more
than six or so employees.

The former was accurate! The latter remains to be seen. We're at about
seventy people now and I still feel like I'm contributing value. But, of
course, I _would_ say that, wouldn't I?

## What do you know how that you wish you'd known then?

#### Management is it's own discipline, worthy of study itself.

In the beginning, I wrote a lot of code. Pretty quickly, I hired another
engineer (the very capable Matt George) and worked alongside someone who was a
much better developer than myself. Over a few short years, we built a crack team
of engineers that included some top-caliber folks like Jason Myers and Will
Golden. During that time, I still saw myself as a developer first, and a team
lead secondly. I considered the term "manager" as a pejorative and thus did not
feel it was necessary for me to educate myself on what it _meant_ to be a
manager. After all, I had a degree in Business Administration, so I already knew
what that meant, right?

Wrong. Management is it's own discipline. It took me probably four to five years
to properly understand just how different that discipline was from the craft of
software development. When I say "management" I don't mean "business
management". I mean it in the Andrew Grove sense of the term: being responsible
for growing the output of my team. Manager as enabler: removing impediments
(often in the form of bad processes), keeping the team healthy, etc.

I still feel that having _some_ technical expertise is helpful if you're going
to be responsible for the technical side of a product company, but it's less
important than the ability to solve problems (a talent most developers have in
spades!), have healthy and honest conversations, and communicate a vision that
everyone can be excited about.

#### Product management is hard.

When you start a company, you wear _all_ of the hats. As you hire people, you
get to hand off some of those hats to folks who do that job well. Among the many
hats I've worn (developer, security guy, IT support, compliance expert,
reader-of-contracts...) product manager is one of the hardest. Being a product
manager is a mess of vision casting, strategic planning, data analysis, and
domain expertise.  Furthermore, is a company nexus that sits between sales,
development, and the C-suite's future vision. It has tension with everyone because you have to
balance capacity with endless ideas. Someone has to be told "no." Not everyone
takes it well.

We still have a lot of work to do on this front. The hardest thing about a
growing company (even one that is growing organically and relatively steadily)
is that the needs of the day are _constantly_ changing. The minute you think
you've gotten the organizational structure in a sweet spot, something new
happens.

## Would you do it again?

Absolutely. But only with the exact same people.

I have said this many times in person, but the two things that I've enjoyed the
most about the whole ride are, in this order:

1. The people I have gotten to work with.
1. The problems I get to solve.

There's a reason I still list "Problem Solving" as my job title on LinkedIn.
It's what got me into software development, and why I'm still here.

## Other Important Things

#### Shared values are paramount.

Jason deserves most of the credit for Stratasan's success. What convinced me to
work with Jason was not his winsome ways (although they are pretty winsome!). It
was his shared values. It's what made our relationship work not just in the
short term while we're figuring things out, but also in the long term: even in
the valley of entrepreneurial despair.

Jason's core values have a significant impact on _Stratasan's_ core values. It
was important that _his_ values align with the entire leadership team, including
mine. Otherwise there will be irreconcilable differences in how we think about
business.

#### The leadership team will benefit from having technical expertise.

Having a technical expert in leadership is important. (Of course, I _would_ say
that, wouldn't I?)

Having someone with even a modicum of technical background in the same room as
the board has been helpful for us. Being able to hear about concerns, trends,
and strategies straight from the investors is critical. Companies are always
talking about organizational _alignment_ - and for good reasons! If you're a product company, you
should put your product people in the same room with your business operations
and domain experts. Why? Because product people are great at problem solving.
Often your investors will be most familiar with the problem at hand (that's
why they're willing to put up money and embrace the risk of backing a startup!).
The less layers you have between your top technical leadership and the board, the
better.

I wish I knew! When we started the company, I told Jason that I probably
wouldn't stick around for very long. I assumed that by the time we hit six
employees, I would probably be doing something else. Ten years later and seventy
people and I'm still loving every minute of it. I can't wait to see what the
next decade looks like!
