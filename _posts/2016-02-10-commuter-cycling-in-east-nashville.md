I want to talk about cycling for a moment. I live in East Nashville and I work
downtown. The neighborhood's proximity to downtown is ideal for a daily bicycle
commute. My ride is approximately five miles, which can be accomplished in less
than half an hour. In spite of the nice bike lanes on my side of town, the
interstate creates a barrier that discourages commuters from cycling. Herein I
attempt to explain why.

These are all of the possible routes into downtown Nashville from the east side.
Let's take them one by one.

### Spring Street

This street, theoretically, has a "bike lane." Here's a shot of it.

![Spring Street "bike lane"](/img/2016-02-10-commuter-cycling-spring-street.png)

I presume these chalked lines indicate that this is a "shared" road. Either that
or it's the chalk outlines of where they found the bodies of cyclists fool-hardy
enough to take this route. We have multiple lanes of traffic, some of which
exit off of and enter onto Ellington Parkway. The only lane of choice for a
cyclist is the center lane where they are caught in merging traffic.
Furthermore, the road is in a curve so visibility is at a minimum. A vehicle
overtaking a cyclist would not see them until the last possible moment.

If you travel along this road headed into downtown, you'll find yourself here.

Here you will encounter cars coming off of Dickerson Pike, merging with
Interstate 65 North and South. You can ride in the right lane, but cars are
going to be annoyed at you for blocking their entrance and exit and yes they are
going to blow their horn and yell at you to get on the sidewalk. Beyond being
annoying, this is yet another horribly dangerous intersection that is not
suitable for commuting cyclists.

Here's a close-up of the route where you can see all of the merging lanes and
general mayhem this route would have in store. It's a veritable gauntlet.

![Spring Street Route Overview](/img/2016-02-10-commuter-cycling-spring-street-route.png)

I have driven this route for years now and I have yet to see a single cyclist on
Spring Street. This is, practically, not an option. To call it a bike route is
an insult to the English language. It is meaningless.

Let's move on to the next route.

### Main Street

This route, also, has a "bike lane."

![Main Street](/img/2016-02-10-commuter-cycling-main-street.png)

Unfortunately, it is also afflicted with the problem of Interstate 65 ramps on
both sides. Again, the cyclist is forced into a center lane and into the wrath
of the motorized vehicles. You also have to contend with the fact that Main
Street funnels from two lanes to one lane when you cross 5th Avenue as well as
the Ellington Parkway off-ramp. All of this is quite intimidating, and even if
you obey the laws of the road, vehicles will be annoyed that you're not over to
the side (in the merge lane).

The other side of the interstate isn't much better. This is looking towards
downtown but you get a sense of what the street-scape is like in both directions.

![Main Street](/img/2016-02-10-commuter-cycling-main-street-2.png)

You've got five lanes of traffic. Typically during rush hour this is a very busy
street. Cars are entering and exiting the interstate. The middle lane on Main
Street south of the Interstate switches direction based on traffic. You have
five lanes of traffic all the way from the Interstate to downtown. Everything
about this road is set up to accommodate vehicles - there is very little
concession made to either pedestrians or cyclists.

Here's an aerial shot of the whole mess.

This option is certainly better than Spring Street, but it's still terrifying.
Let's see what Woodland Street holds in store.

### Woodland Street

This street has no designated bike route. However, at first glance it looks like
a really great route. Here's a shot looking towards downtown.

![Woodland Street](/img/2016-02-10-commuter-cycling-main-street-2.png)

On the southbound side you have no exit or entrance ramps. Sure, there are two
lanes but otherwise this is pretty smooth sailing. No one is going to be mad at
you for riding in the right-hand lane.

This is actually my preferred route into downtown.

How about heading back home? Alas, we're again faced with an entrance ramp.

![Woodland Street Northbound](/img/2016-02-10-commuter-cycling-woodland-st-northbound.png)

Not only is there an entrance lamp, but the far right hand lane is a turn lane.
This forces the cyclist into the second left-most lane. Again, we're faced with
the wrate of the drivers encased in steel and glass who cannot understand why
this crazy man on a bicycle is slowing them down. They toot their horns, roll
down their windows, yell, swear, and generally act like imbeciles. I generally
do not take this route as I do not like to deal with angry drivers. It is, I
suspect, discouraging to anyone wishing to commute via bicycle.

We have one route left.

### Shelby Street

# TODO

### Davidson Street

![Davidson Street](/img/2016-02-10-commuter-cycling-davidson-street.png)

This street view is actually out of date. The bicycle lane you see above has
been replaced with a buffered split lane that runs along the south side of
Davidson Street. It's quite nice (even if it does pose a problem for some
motorists who do not [look to their
right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZJ9UwSN9jM&feature=youtu.be) when
entering Davidson Street). There are also no ramps onto I-65. It's not beautiful
(it runs through a metals trash dump) but that can hardly be a valid complaint.

The only problem with this route is that if you need to travel up Main Street or
Woodland Street (as I do) it is a rather out-of-the-way route.
