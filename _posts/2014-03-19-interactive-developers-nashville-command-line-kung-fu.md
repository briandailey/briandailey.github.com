Last night I presented ["Command Line Kung Fu" to the Interactive Developers of
Nashville](http://www.meetup.com/interactivedev/events/135589052/) group in Brentwood. I enjoyed the discussion around the Unix
philosophy of modularity and how the various tools complement one another to do
powerful things.

I appreciate ID hosting me for the evening, and I hope it was useful to the
attendees! Thanks to all of those that were able to make it, and thanks to my
colleague [Jason Myers](http://www.jasonamyers.com/) for lending moral support.

Slides from the talk are available
[here](http://dailytechnology.net/talk-cli-intro/?theme=sky). If you want to
see my notes for the talk, you can press the 's' key to open the speakers
notes. As usual, I used [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) for
building the presentation itself.
