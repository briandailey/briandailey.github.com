Last night I presented ["Command Line Kung Fu" to the Interactive Developers of
Nashville](http://www.meetup.com/interactivedev/events/135589052/) group in Brentwood. I enjoyed the discussion around the Unix
philosophy of modularity and how the various tools complement one another to do
powerful things.

This is a talk I've actually given a [few]({% post_url 2009-04-25-nyphp-presentation-become-a-bash-ninja %})
[times](http://www.slideshare.net/brian_dailey/devchatt-2010-nix-cmd-line-kung-foo)
[before]({% post_url 2009-10-23-command-line-kung-fu-at-ruby-on-rails-october-meeting %}) with
some variations.

I appreciate ID hosting me for the evening, and I hope it was useful to the
attendees! Thanks to all of those that were able to make it, and thanks to my
colleague [Jason Myers](http://www.jasonamyers.com/) for lending moral support.

Slides from the talk are available
