<p>A lot of the material I went over was from the NYPHP presentation that I gave earlier this year, but I did spend a little more time on functionality specific to the bash prompt.</p>

<p>A couple of the things that seemed to generate the most enthusiasm:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Using "cd -" to toggle between the most recently viewed directories.</li>
    <li>The use of GNU screen.</li>
    <li>Using aliases, especially for aliasing mysql --safe-updates</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin: 0 10px 10px 0; float: left;">

</div>

<p>Some of the attendees had their own useful suggestions. Daniel Nelson pointed out that Ctrl+N and Ctrl+P is faster than using arrow keys to navigate through your command history. He also pointed out that you could pass command output into arguments using parenthesis. For example:</p>

{% highlight sh %}
diff <(ls -l) <(ls ../ -l)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>That's pretty slick if you ask me!</p>

<p>A lot of PHP guys showed up, so there was some interest in a small function I wrote to parse out information from the php.net information pages. Here it is in it's full glory:</p>

{% highlight sh %}
phpargs() {
    curl -s http://us3.php.net/$1 | \
        sed -n '/<div class="methodsynopsis dc-description">/,/<\/div>/p' | \
        sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' | tr -d "\n"
    echo
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>It's pretty basic, but if you add this to your bash profile you can run it by passing a function name.</p>

{% highlight sh %}
phpargs strpos
int strpos    ( string $haystack   , mixed $needle   [, int $offset = 0  ] )
{% endhighlight %}
</pre>

<p>Again, if you're reading this and you're not checking out your local user groups, then I encourage you to do so! Even smaller cities often have user groups and they are a valuable place to both learn things and share what you know.</p>
