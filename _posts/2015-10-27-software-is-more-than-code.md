"What language should I focus my efforts on?" It's one of the most common
questions I hear when talking to aspiring software developers. When the question
is posed they are disappointed that most senior developers refuse to give them
a clear answer. Basically, the language choice itself is relatively minor
compared to all of the other things you need to focus on to grow as a software
developer.

(To be fair, the question really boils down to "What language has the most
demand (and therefore makes it easier for me to find a job)?" In that case, the
answer is best obtained via a [quick
search](https://www.google.com/search?q=most+popular+software+language&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8).)

Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.'s classic essay [_No Silver Bullet â€” Essence and Accident in Software
Engineering_](http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf) is one of my
favorite essays found in one of my favorite development life cycle-related books,
_The Mythical Man Month_. His fundamental argument is as follows:

> There is no single development, in either technology or management
> technique, which by itself promises even one order-of-magnitude
> improvement within a decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity.

_Technology_, in the above quote, includes programming languages. There really
is no "best" language to learn. Some are easier to learn then others; some are
better suited to particular tasks; others suit programming styles in ways that
please particular developers.

Dr. Brooks goes on to say:

> I believe the hard part of building software to be the specification, design,
> and testing of this conceptual construct, not the labor of representing it and
> testing the fidelity of the representation.  We still make syntax errors, to be
> sure; but they are fuzz compared to the conceptual errors in most systems.

To put it another way: writing the code is the easy part. Specification, design,
and testing are the real meat of software development. These are the tasks that
are both difficult to teach and difficult to learn. Teaching to write code, in
comparison, is relatively simple.

Dr. Brooks goes on to cover some of the hopes for the silver bullet. In one of them
he even alludes to writing comprehensive tests (he calls it _program verification_).

> More seriously, even perfect program verification can only establish that a
> program meets its specification.  The hardest part of the software task is
> arriving at a complete and consistent specification, and _much of the essence
> of building a program is in fact the debugging of the specification_.

(Emphasis added.) Again, Dr. Brooks concludes that the "essence" of software development
is in refining the specification.

What is the takeaway here for an aspiring software developer?

In my humble opinion, the best developers are _good communicators_. They may not
know how to write a [doubly linked
list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) from scratch but they
can take a incomplete specification and:

* Conceptualize how it will work
* Refine the specification to make it more... specific.
* Identify traps that may cause errors in communication

Don't spend too much time deciding what language you should learn. The real meat
of software development is problem-solving. Find a problem. Solve it. Doing so
might even involve writing some code.

If you haven't read it, Dr. Brook's essay is online in it's entirety. Even though
it was written in 1986, it's still very much worth a read. At 16 pages, it won't
even demand much of your time. Find it
