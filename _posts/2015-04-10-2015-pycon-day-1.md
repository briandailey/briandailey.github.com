I have been fortunate enough to attend four PyCon conferences. I find that it
helps me to maximize my experience if I take notes and summarize them each day.
Perhaps I will later roll this into a post that summarizes the entire
conference.

Notes from my day:

* PyCon puts all of their talks into [GuideBook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guidebook.android). Use it! It's a great way to manage a schedule!
* If you can avoid it, *don't* open your laptop during a talk! It's terribly distracting and data has shown that [you retain more information if you take notes by hand](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/).
  * Sure, monitoring IRC and/or Twitter may be great, but know that it comes with a cost.

My notes for each talk:

### Opening Statement: [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk)

Wow, is Julia enthusiastic or not? She gave a whirlwind overview of PyCon.
Highlights included the usual Code of Conduct, their efforts to increase
diversity of speakers and attendees, and the $200,000 in donated financial aid
(aiding 291 attendees, or more than 10% of the total).

### Keynote: [Catherine Bracy](https://twitter.com/cbracy)

Catherine is the Director of Community Organizing at Code for America. She
doesn't have a technical background, from what I gathered, but she is quite
passionate about getting the populace engaged in goverment. I'm a bit of a
pessimist on this front, especially after reading [The Myth of the Rational
Voter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter), but I
appreciate her enthusiasm and wish her organization the best of luck.

Her talk was very eloquent. She pointed out many of the glaring inefficiencies
in government-led IT (the most high-profile of which was the Healthcare.gov
crash as the Affordable Care Act went into effect). Other examples included high
school students in Los Angeles sitting in an auditorium while their class
scheduling system was sorted out and Floridians being unable to claim unemployment
benefits because of issues with their online-only tool.

### Building Secure Systems: [lvh](https://twitter.com/lvh)

I am an avid reader of [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/) ever since
attending [the Last HOPE](http://www.thelasthope.org/) conference (associated
with the venerable 2600 hacker quarterly), so I appreciated lvh's talk. He
highlighted the fact that typically our job as developers is to *make it work*,
not to make it fail; the latter is how security operations are tested. He
mentioned that new features will always be more exciting and interesting than
security in the form of bugs. As he pointed out, this is a rational
self-interested decision many companies make: if you look at market cap, it
doesn't really shift much after a huge security disclosure. He did not say this,
but ultimately, consumers will have to become more security-sensitive for this
lack of priority to ever change.

lvh mentioned that most computer science courses include the [Liskov
substitution principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)
as part of their cirriculum, but they do not include the [principle of least
authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) (or
privilege), which ultimately might be a more useful topic.

He also mentioned a free resource he put together,
[crypto101.io](https://www.crypto101.io/):

>  Crypto 101 is an introductory course on cryptography, freely available for
>  programmers of all ages and skill levels.

I really enjoyed his talk, although it covered security on a sufficiently high
enough level that I have heard most of it before.

### Introduction to HTTPS - A Comedy of Errors: [Ashwini Oruganti](https://twitter.com/_ashfall_)

Ashwini had given this talk at
[PyTennessee](https://www.pytennessee.org/schedule/presentation/84/) and I heard
good things about it, so I was happy to catch it at PyCon. It is quite obvious
that this contributor to a pure Python TLS implementation is quite familiar with
how HTTPS works.

She first mentioned out that
[`urllib`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html) is fundamentally
flawed in that it does not do any kind of server certificate validation.
Any fool with [ettercap](http://ettercap.github.io/ettercap/) and
[mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) can give you a bad time.
Fortunately, there are alternative tools at the Pythonista's disposal (e.g.,
Python 3 and the [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
library).

Furthermore, says Ashwini: SSL is busted; use TLS.

She pointed to a few nice resources, not least of which was [Hynek's guide to
configuring
TLS](https://hynek.me/articles/hardening-your-web-servers-ssl-ciphers/), which
has has been kept updated. She also mentioned the book [The Tangled
Web: A Guide to Securing Modern Web Applications](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593273886/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1593273886&linkCode=as2&tag=rea036-20&linkId=ZRZVXBNZ2WBTZUVI).

The big takeaway from this talk: test your clients against servers with bad
certificates. They should fail! If they don't, fix that.

### A Dive into TLS: [Benjamin Peterson](https://twitter.com/gutworth)

This talk was retitled "The (Less) Sorry State of SSL in Python" and it did
indeed turn out to be an overview of the how things have changed in the Python
library since [Hynek's
talk titled 'The Sorry State of SSL'](https://hynek.me/talks/tls/).

As I don't really use Python to consume TLS, this talk was not quite as useful
to me. Peterson, however, is a very engaging speaker.

### Distributed Systems 101: lvh

This talk was so over my head I had a really hard time keeping up. Distributed
systems is not something I spend a lot of brain power one (if I need something
distributed, I tend to rely on services to fill that gap). lvh went into the
talk saying that he wanted to impress everyone with how hard distributed systems
are, and I suppose he did just that.

My biggest takeaway was that there are three things you want from distributed
systems. If you draw them in circles and imagine a Venn diagram, you cannot get
all three. You can only pick 2.

* Consistency
* Availability
* Partition tolerance

Basically, the last one, partition tolerance, is not really optional. So most
systems concentrate on the gradient between consistency and availability.

### Smart Services & Smart Clients - How Microservices Change the Way You Build and Deploy Code: [Frank Statton](https://twitter.com/frankrstratton)

Frank is the CTO and Runscope, and he took a nice in-depth look at how Runscope
manages their infrastructure in ways that minimize tight coupling.

I had a splitting headache during this talk so unfortunately I had to make an
exit to hunt down some pain medication. Alas, it appeared to be a good talk.
I'll have to catch the video later.

### Stop Sucking Me Into Your Drama: A Personal Appeal for Loose Coupling: Augie Fackler, Nathaniel Manista

I really enjoyed how these two tag-teamed their talk. It kept the topic fresh and
entertaining as they would bounce back and forth.

This topic is similar to what you would read in Bob Martin's Clean Code or Steve
McConnell's Code Complete.

### CoreOS: [Dan Callahan](https://twitter.com/callahad)

I've used the lightweight Linux distro CoreOS for managing Docker on Mac OS X,
but I had no idea that the distro had so many things going on.

First Dan went over the basics of why we like containers. After that, he went
over:

* FastPatch for opportunistic, recoverable upgrades.
* Docker for containerization
* etcd for consensus
  * If updates are automatically applied, how do I make sure my system is stable? etcd is the answer!
  * But wait, if etcd is also running on CoreOS, how do I make sure my system is stable? The answer is more etcd! Dan recommended 5 etcd nodes.
  * Maor virtual machines!
* Fleet for scheduling.

If I had one word to describe CoreOS it would be "clever." Of course, sometimes
clever can get you into trouble.

### Board Games

After dinner I joined a group of Pythonistas to play some board games generously
provided by [Randolph's Pub](http://www.randolph.ca/?lang=en). This pub has
thousands of games and you can go there to drink beer and play. How fantastic is
that? May have to visit them before I leave.

Games I played:

* [Carcassonne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_%28board_game%29), which I've played before.
* [Love Letter](http://www.alderac.com/loveletter/), I've heard of it but never played. Enjoyed it.
* [King of Tokyo](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/70323/king-tokyo) a very amusing game for 4-6 players

### Wrap-up

Now I'm exhausted and I need to go to bed in order to be ready for tomorrow
morning's 5k!
