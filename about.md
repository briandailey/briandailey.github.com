Hi, my name is Brian. I am a web developer. As of 2013, I am busy in Nashville with [Stratasan](http://stratasan.com), a company I co-founded with [Jason Moore](http://twitter.com/jasonrmoore) and [Tod Fetherling](http://twitter.com/jtodwork/) in 2010. I also occasionally do freelance work under the business name [Realm3](http://realm3.com).

My current language of choice is Python. You can see some of my projects on [GitHub](http://github.com/briandailey). If you would like to find out more about projects I've worked on in the past, see the [Projects](/projects/) page.

If you want to get in touch with me, you can reach me at [@byeliad](http://twitter.com/byeliad) on Twitter. You can also find me on Freenode on #pynash, #nashdl, and elsewhere. If you must, you can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/briandailey).
